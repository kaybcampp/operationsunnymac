Here’s a README file that encapsulates your application’s purpose, functionality, and technical overview:

Solar Estimator Project
Overview
The Solar Estimator Project is an interactive web application built by Kayb Campbell specifically for the team at SunnyMac Solar. This application serves as a demonstration of my technical skills and as a potential solution to improve SunnyMac Solar's online user experience. Unlike traditional resumes, this project showcases my approach to addressing a real-world issue I encountered on SunnyMac’s website, where their existing “Design Your System” tool experienced errors, requiring users to fill out a form for follow-up. The Solar Estimator Project offers an automated, real-time estimation experience that is accurate and user-friendly.

Purpose
The primary goal of this application is to present a practical and intuitive solution that enhances user engagement by offering an immediate cost estimation for solar panel installations. Users can enter details about their home and energy needs to receive an interactive estimate without requiring additional follow-up. This project demonstrates my skills in back-end logic, front-end design, and user interface development, with the aim of joining the SunnyMac Solar team to contribute to its innovative solutions in renewable energy.

Features
Intro Page

A welcome page that introduces the project, detailing its purpose and my motivation behind creating it.
Typing animation effect with an optional "Skip Animation" button.
Estimator Logic Page

A detailed breakdown of the estimation logic, explaining each step of the calculation and assumptions used to provide accurate estimates.
Solar Panel Estimator Page

Allows users to input various data points:
Square footage of the home
Style of the home (single-story or multi-story)
Desired roof coverage percentage for solar panels
Current monthly electricity bill
Provides an estimated cost for solar panel installation based on user inputs.
Encourages users to experiment with different values to see how the estimator adapts.
About Me Page

Shares information about my background, programming experience, and why I'm excited about the opportunity at SunnyMac Solar.
Includes links to my GitHub profile and resume, along with contact information for easy follow-up.
Technical Overview
This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here’s a breakdown of the core elements:

HTML/CSS: Provides a clean, accessible, and user-friendly interface, with a dark-themed layout and green accents to maintain a professional look and feel.
JavaScript: Powers the back-end logic for estimating solar panel costs based on the following calculations:
Roof Size Calculation: Multiplies the square footage by a factor based on the home’s style (1.15 for single-story, 1.4 for multi-story).
Usable Roof Area: Calculates based on the percentage of roof coverage desired by the user.
Solar Panel Count: Estimates the number of panels needed (each panel covers approximately 17 sq ft).
Total Cost Calculation: Multiplies the panel count by a default cost per panel of $300 and factors in 10% of the user’s annual electricity bill to cover additional expenses.
Responsive Navigation Bar: Each page includes a navigation bar that highlights the active page, enabling seamless movement between the Intro, Estimator Logic, Estimator, and About Me sections.
Getting Started
To test the application locally:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open index.html in a web browser.
Navigate through the pages using the navigation bar to explore each feature.
Future Development
If this project is selected, I am eager to expand its features, potentially integrating additional data sources, refining the UI, and implementing a real-time back-end server connection to fetch live data. I am also open to customizing the estimator based on specific requirements from SunnyMac Solar.
